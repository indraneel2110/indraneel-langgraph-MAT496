## MODULE 1:


### Vid-1: Motivation
- **Learnings:** Learnt a bit about what langgraph is: a more low level and more controllable framework compared to langchain, what do we want to achieve with it: basically we want to use it to balance the application's reliablity as agent control increases. Also peeked into the future what we'll learn throughout the course.
