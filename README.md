## MODULE 1:


### Vid-1: Motivation
- **Learnings:** Learnt a bit about what langgraph is: a more low level and more controllable framework compared to langchain, what do we want to achieve with it: basically we want to use it to balance the application's reliablity as agent control increases. Also peeked into the future what we'll learn throughout the course.

### Vid-2: Simple Graph
- **Learnings:** Learnt how to deploy basic graph mechanisms like making nodes: starting node, end node and the nodes in between, and using state to decide which node to visit.
- **Changes:** made another node and changed the randomness from 50-50 to 30-30-30 between 3 nodes, changed the prompts
